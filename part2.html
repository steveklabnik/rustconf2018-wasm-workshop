# .slide-header[Overview]

- Code is written in Rust
- Rust is compiled to a WASM target
- `wasm-bindgen` translates Rust function signatures to WASM
- `wasm-pack` packages the compiled code for npm
- `webpack` bundles the code for the browser

# Tools

## - `rustup`: a version manager and toolchain installer
## - `cargo`: a package manager, build tool, test runner, and documentation generator

## Setting up a Project

We're going to be making a *library* project; the other option is a *binary* or application.

`cargo new` will create a skeleton project setup for you.

1. `cd` to a directory where you like to store code
2. `cargo new hello-wasm`
3. `cd hello-wasm`

## Files created

- `Cargo.toml`: metadata about your project and its dependencies
- `.gitignore`: ignores compiled files built by Rust
- `src/lib.rs`: where your Rust code goes

## `Cargo.toml`

This file contains metadata about your project as well as all the information about its dependencies.
It's like a `package.json`.

```toml
[package]
name = "hello-wasm"
description = "a crate to learn about wasm"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Ashley Williams <ashley666ashley@gmail.com>"]
license = "WTFPL"
repository = "https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/hello-wasm"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.1.0"
```

## Variables

```rust
let name = "ashley";
let age = 30;
println!("Hi, {}! You are {} years old.", name, age);
```

## Mutability

Variables are *immutable* by default in Rust.

```rust
let name = "ashley";
let mut age = 30;
age += 1;
println!("Hi, {}! You are ACTUALLY {} years old.", name, age);
```

class: left, top, string

# .slide-header[A Brief Intro to Rust]

## A Tale of Two Strings

Strings are actually quite complicated! Dynamic languages hide this, but *sadly* Rust doesn't.
In the beginning strings in Rust can feel difficult :(

### `String`

* Full featured with convenience methods
* Can create with either:
  * `something.to_string()` OR `String::from("string slice")`

### `&str`

* Pronounced "and stir" or "string slice"
* Hardcoded strings are `&str`s
